# Playlist Generator
Music is a perfect tool in any scenario - one can create a playlist for any context, any feeling, any "vibe". Yet, with numerous different music streaming platforms, these playlists aren't often easily shared. This playlist generator enables users to share their playlists and personal favorites more freely, across multiple platforms.
